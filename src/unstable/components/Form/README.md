# Form

A component that can be used for generating a form from a [json schema](http://json-schema.org/) object. 
The standard json schema types are supported, as well as the `date-time` format.

Under the hood, this component uses [`react-jsonschema-form`](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form) and support
all [`uiSchema`](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form#the-uischema-object) options from that project.

Additional formats are supported, but require supporting widgets to be loaded.
For example if you would like to support the [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) format, you'll need to
import the widget using `import 'renditon/dist/extra/Form/mermaid'`.

This import only needs to happen once, so it is recommended that its done at the
root level of your application.

This component is experimental and still under development, if you would like to
use it, it can be imported using `import { Form } from 'rendition/dist/unstable'`.

## Custom uiSchema properties

Some templates and widgets support additional uiSchema options, defined using `ui:options` object in the `uiSchema` definition. Those are:

### PasswordWidget

| Name          | Type      | Default   | Required   | Description                                          |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| `showPasswordStrengthMeter`    | `boolean` | false | - | A boolean denoting whether a password strenth meter will be shown. `zxcvbn` should be loaded beforehand and set to the window object as `window.zxcvbn` |

### ObjectField

| Name          | Type      | Default   | Required   | Description                                          |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| `responsive`    | `boolean` | false | - | A boolean denoting whether the object fields should be wrapped in a row-directed flex container and wrap once their size is larger than the minimum|
| `flex`    | `Array<number | string>` | - | - | Works together with `responsive`. It passes the `flex` value to the same-indexed field in the object. This allows you to have more control over the layout of the fields |


## Captcha

If you wish to use a captcha (google recaptcha v2) in your form, you need to load the `captcha` widget using `import { CaptchaWidget } from 'rendition/dist/extra/Form/captcha'` and register it using `registerWidget` (see [story source](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/rendition/blob/master/src/unstable/components/Form/story.js)).

In order for the captcha to work, you also need to set a valid recaptcha API key to the `window.RECAPTCHA_V2_API_KEY` variable.
A gotcha with the captcha widget is, upon submitting, you need to reset the captcha form value where you manage its state. Google only allows a captcha value (generated by clicking the captcha widget) to be verified only once against their API, after which it will be invalid so it needs to be reset.

## API

### `registerWidget(format, widget)`

Register a widget that will be used to render fields of the specified format.
