# Form

A component that can be used for generating a form from a [json schema](http://json-schema.org/) object. 
The standard json schema types are supported, as well as the `date-time` format.

Under the hood, this component uses [`react-jsonschema-form`][2] and support
all [`uiSchema`][3] options from that project.

Additional formats are supported, but require supporting widgets to be loaded.
For example if you would like to support the [mermaid][1] format, you'll need to
import the widget using `import 'renditon/dist/extra/Form/mermaid'`.
This import only needs to happen once, so it is recommended that its done at the
root level of your application.

This component is experimental and still under development, if you would like to
use it, it can be imported using `import { Form } from 'rendition/dist/unstable'`.
