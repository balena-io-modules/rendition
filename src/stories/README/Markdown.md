# Markdown

A simple component for rendering [GitHub flavored markdown][1]. This component
sanitizes input.
This component is not loaded by default as it relies on a markdown parsing package 
that you may not want to include in your application.
You can load this component using:

```
import { Markdown } from 'rendition/dist/extra/Markdown';
```
